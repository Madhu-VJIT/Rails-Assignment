Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFieldOption (
message:
  Invalid option :presence provided for field :original.
summary:
  Mongoid requires that you only provide valid options on each field definition in order to prevent unexpected behavior later on.
resolution:
  When defining the field :original on 'Url', please provide valid options for the field. These are currently: as, default, identity, label, localize, fallbacks, association, pre_processed, subtype, type, overwrite. If you meant to define a custom field option, please do so first as follows:

   Mongoid::Fields.option :presence do |model, field, value|
     # Your logic here...
   end
   class Url
     include Mongoid::Document

Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFieldOption (
message:
  Invalid option :length provided for field :original_url.
summary:
  Mongoid requires that you only provide valid options on each field definition in order to prevent unexpected behavior later on.
resolution:
  When defining the field :original_url on 'Url', please provide valid options for the field. These are currently: as, default, identity, label, localize, fallbacks, association, pre_processed, subtype, type, overwrite. If you meant to define a custom field option, please do so first as follows:

   Mongoid::Fields.option :length do |model, field, value|
     # Your logic here...
   end
   class Url
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :original_url, length: true
   end

 Refer to: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/reference/fields/#custom-field-options):
